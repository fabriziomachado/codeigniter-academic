Feature: ls
  In order to see the directory structure
  As a UNIX user
  I need to be able to list the current directory's contents
  
  Scenario: List 2 files in a directory
  Given I am in a directory "test"
  And I have a file named "foo"
  And I have a file named "bar"
  When I run "ls"
  Then I should get:
    """
    bar
    foo
    """
    
  Scenario: List 2 files in a directory with the -a option
  Given I am in a directory "test"
  And I have a file named "foo"
  And I have a file named "bar"
  When I run "ls -a"
  Then I should get:
    """
    .
    ..
    bar
    foo
    """
